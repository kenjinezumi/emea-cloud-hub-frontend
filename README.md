# Cloud Hub

Welcome to Cloud Hub! This project is designed to have separate directories for the backend and frontend components.

## Backend

The `backend` directory contains all the code related to the backend of the application. This includes server-side logic, APIs, database interactions, and any other backend-specific code. You'll find files such as server.js, controllers, models, routes, and database configurations here.

## Frontend

The `frontend` directory contains all the code related to the frontend of the application. This includes client-side code, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components or any other frontend frameworks or libraries you may be using. You'll find files such as index.html, stylesheets, scripts, and frontend-specific configurations here.

Having separate directories for backend and frontend helps in organizing the project structure, keeping the codebase modular, and making it easier to manage and maintain.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the `backend` and `frontend` directories separately and install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Backend Server:** Start the backend server by running the following command in the `backend` directory:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server:** Start the frontend development server by running the following command in the `frontend` directory:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

5. **Open the Application:** Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
